Simple Shared Memory Example

This repository provides a simple example of how to use shared memory for interprocess communication in a Unix-like environment. The example provides an implementation of two basic functions: a shared memory-based "get" function that reads data from a shared memory segment, and a shared memory-based "set" function that writes data to a shared memory segment.

The repository is designed to be easy to use and understand, and includes detailed documentation and code comments to help users get started quickly. The codebase is written in C, and includes example programs that demonstrate how to use the shared memory functions in a variety of scenarios.

Whether you are new to shared memory or an experienced developer looking for a simple, reliable solution for interprocess communication, this repository provides a great starting point for your next project.

Keywords: shared memory, interprocess communication, Unix, C programming, examples, documentation.
